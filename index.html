    <p>12 things to know before taking your first surf lesson
21 June 2018 | by Manu
It's already summer and since you're on holiday by the sea, you might as well do something fun. And then surfing is everyone's dream. A real popular fantasy. Those men and women who glide across the water standing on a board, it makes you want to do the same. But if it looks so easy when you see them taking turns on the waves, it quickly becomes less sexy when you try to do the same... These guys are literally flying on the water and we are more in the style of beached whale or seal in distress. But don't worry, Rome wasn't built in a day and these handsome surfers had to start one day too. So with a few good tips and tricks, you can also get your head out of the water and hold on for more than a second on that damn board. That's why, come and take lessons with PHIB!
